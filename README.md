Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
I have implemented a deep LSTM network for stock price prediction. LSTM is a type of artificial neural network that is well-suited for time series analysis, allowing for effective handling of data with multiple input and output timesteps

Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms
I have also worked on the Titanic survival prediction using various machine learning algorithms, including:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVC)
k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
Perceptron
